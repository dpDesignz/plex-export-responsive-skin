# plex-export-responsive-skin

 A responsive skin for use the with [Plex-Export](https://github.com/Dachande663/Plex-Export) script from Dachande663, with some slight changes and fixes in the `plex.js` file

## Installation

Simply [download a copy of this repo](https://github.com/dpDesignz/plex-export-responsive-skin/archive/master.zip) and upload the `index.html` and `assets` folder to the same location as your current export folder, overwriting the existing files.

## Vanilla js

I am also working on re-writing the `plex.js` file in vanilla javascript which you are welcome to try. Just change the `<script src="assets/js/plex.js"></script>` line to `<script src="assets/js/vanilla-plex.js"></script>` ~~and remove the requirement for `jquery.1.4.4`~~ (not ready for this yet).

I have commented as much of the code as I've completed to make it easier if you want to help debug anything.
